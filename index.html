    <ul>
        <li>Saltworth is a “New World” Tech Staff Management Company created to shake up the recruitment agency industry</li>
        <li>Instead of having a bunch of salaried Recruitment Consultants in swanky CBD offices, we run an independent Tech Agent model</li>
        <li>Saltworth challenges norms by combining a Results Only Work Environment (ROWE) while operating from mobile offices, incurring
            not a single dollar to house employees in static corporate office space</li>
        <li>By minimising overhead baggage and not carrying passengers, the Saltworth cost of hire is based on flat-fees that work out
            to be around 50% less than agency rates</li>
        <li>We don’t get our people from internet adverts or deal with job-seekers per se</li>
        <li>We discreetly manage, promote and represent only the finest tech professionals</li>
        <li>Backing the best as sole agents, Saltworth stands for people and services worth paying for</li>
        <li>Saltworth donates 3% of its group profits to
            <a href="www.codefuture.org">Code the Future</a>helping to create a future where every child leaves school knowing how to code
